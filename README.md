## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Observe whether the development server starts successfully.  Repeat steps 2-3 several times.  The problem is intermittent, so it may require multiple attempts to reproduce.

## Expected Behavior

The `expo start` command should consistently launch the development server without errors.

## Actual Behavior

The `expo start` command sometimes fails to launch the development server, producing a vague error message related to Webpack or Metro configuration.
